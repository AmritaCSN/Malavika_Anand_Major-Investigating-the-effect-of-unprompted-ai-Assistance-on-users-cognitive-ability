<p align="left">Exploring the impact of unprompted AI assistance on human cognitive abilities and the implications for security critical tasks.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>

###

<p align="left">Our hypothesis is that unprompted assistance degrades the human cognitive thinking and disengages the human from their own critical thinking ability. In this project, we are studying and investigating the impact of unprompted assistance on human cognitive abilities. To test our hypothesis we are going to conduct an aptitude quiz among a group of students. This repository has the codes for the quiz application for all three scenarios that is proposed.<br><br>- No AI Assistance<br>- Prompted AI Assistance<br>- Unprompted AI Assistance</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Requirements:</h2>

###

<p align="left">To run this code you'll need:<br>1) Python 3- Anaconda<br>2) Visual Studio Code or Jupyter notebook</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Usage</h2>

###

<p align="left">Step-1: Clone the repo and pull the latest code<br><br>Step-2: To run the notebooks, make sure you run the notebook using the python interpretor- anaconda <br><br> Step-3: First run get_csv.py file to get all the csv files from the database and this will be stored in a folder called 'data'.<br>Post that, run the cleanup.py file to define the functions inside the file which is done for pre-processing the data.<br><br>Step-4: Now you'll have the csv's loaded in the 'data' folder, and now you can run your notebook which will give you the analysis of the data.'</p>
